## Notes
+ [Notes related to the filesystem](https://github.com/dtxc/skbd-fs)

### User task memory layout (8 MB process)
```py
# offset - (0x40000000 + i * 8 MB)
0x00000000   -> end_code        : code
end_code*    -> buffer_start**  : heap
buffer_start -> 0x007DFFFF      : guard page
0x007E0000   -> 0x007FFFFF      : stack (128 kb)
```

*page aligned
<br>
**Some tasks are not allowed to have a buffer, these tasks end up with a larger heap.

### Building & running
```sh
make
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom build/out/os-image.iso -hda image.bin -serial file:serial.log
```

### External binary example
Binary dependencies are currently hardcoded, so modifying `user/Makefile` is required.

```c
#include <stdio.h> // fprintf
#include <stdlib.h> // exit

__attribute__((section(".text._start")))
void _start() {
    fprintf(stdio, "Hello world!\n");
    exit(0);
}
```

## Known bugs
Since time is very limited right now, if a bug doesn't block progress it will be placed here and fixed later.

+ Using global variables inside a user program causes a page fault
+ Context switching after sleep() of a task expires causes undefined behavior
+ Indexing by pid in the tcb array causes undefined behavior (already fixed, will commit soon)
+ tty binary
+ Adding large files in the rootfs corrupts the image

## Third party software
While this operating system uses its own native tools, in also relies on [Scalable Screen Font 2.0](https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/scalable-font2/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads) for font rendering.
